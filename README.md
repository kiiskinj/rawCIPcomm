# rawCIPcomm

Raw TCP socket CIP communication.

Basic idea behind this work is to share an open implementation of CIP communication between two PLCs or with PLC & PC (independent of OS).
TCP communication is happening through 44818 port but of course this can be change in the source code if necessary. 

All comments are more than welcome!
